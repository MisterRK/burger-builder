## Introduction

---
Burger-Builder is all about creating a custom burger and order it for delivery to a location of your choosing. This was a fun way to combine my love of food and technology.

## Tech Stack

---

* ReactJS
* Redux
* Google Firebase ( for realtime database, hosting and authentication )
* Axios ( for HTTP requests )
* Enzyme ( for testing )
* React Router
* React Thunk ( for middleware )

## Setup

---
To get this project running locally you will need to create an application on Google Firebase as well as adjust some settings to allow authentication via email and password and realtime database. I'll be adding a section to this README with screenshots to show you exactly how I went about setting this up for development, but until then here are links to the Firebase docs where things are clearly explained

### Coming Soon

## Examples of Use Cases

---
Ordering system for small burger joint where ordering can be more interactive.

Add a prompt for a specific order, children could use the app to create the burger and then enter the order information to practice spelling and typing.
